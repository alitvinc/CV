### Some interesting facts about me

🥕 I don’t remember exactly when I was 5 or 7 years old, I decided to become a vegetarian. There was no such word in the 90s.

🇩🇪 At first I painted and wanted to become an artist, but then I had to choose to study German. It was the most difficult choice in my life.

✉️ When I was 12-15 years old, I answered several thousand letters in search of meaning in other people's lives. I know how to sort letters and look for talented people.

🗨️ I wrote poetry and participated in competitions with them. I was inspired by the days of Belarusian-Swedish poetry.

🌹 Worked using the p2p method in "The Cobblestones and Roses" project.

👩 ♀️Used the 3-R methodology  to analyze the life of my country, region, words, films and so on.

🎙️ I recorded more than 10 000 interviews.

🔎 I read all the newspapers over the past 30 years in my region to understand what he lived and who lived there. Google didn't have an answer to this question. I have a technique for reading newspapers quickly.

🎥 I made documentaries. I needed to find the most interesting people in my region and make stories about their lives.

😊 I know people who live in Austria, Australia, Argentina, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Chile, England, France, Germany, Georgia, Israel, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Italy, Norway, New Zealand, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Scotland, USA, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine.
